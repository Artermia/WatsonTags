profuse watery diarrhea

I'm vomiting a lot

I'm really nauseous

My heart is pounding, beating heavily

My muscles are aching

I'm very thirsty

I'm having constant diarrhea

I puked

I'm throwing up

My nose is dry

I feel dehydrated

I'm tired

I feel lethargic

I am tired and dehydrated

I have diarrhea and am lethargic
