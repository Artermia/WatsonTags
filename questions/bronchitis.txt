Yellow plegm

Greenish-yellow phlegm

Green phlegm

Spitting green

Sore chest from coughing

My chest rattles occasionally

Constantly get the chills

I wheeze when I breathe

It has become difficult to breath

I'm coughing and spitting green

I'm tired at all moments of the day

I'm tired and have a fever

I'm lethargic and can't breath very well

My chest hurts when I cough

My chest feels sore and my lungs feel weak
