my vision is becoming blurry

my vision is blurry

Blurry in the middle of my eye

Dark circles in the center of my eye

Blurry dark areas in my vision

White circles in my vision

Colors are changing and look different

Straight lines appear curved

Vision is becoming curved

Vision is becoming cloudy

Can't see very well

Eyesight depreciating

Decreasing quality of vision
