my chest is uncomfortable

my stomach hurts

I'm feeling nauseous

I am very lightheaded

There is pressure in my chest

I'm nauseous and vomiting

Pain in my stomach

Nausea and sweating

I can't breath

I feel like I can't breath

My left shoulder hurts and the pain is spreading

I'm having a panic attack

My chest feels like it's squeezing itself

My upper body hurts but no chest pain

I'm sweating and feeling very nauseous
