    Testosterone Deficiency The patient has been doing remarkably well on T therapy. Currently on T cypionate 0.35 cc 2x/wk, HCG 0.5 cc - 500 u- 2x/wk (via 6,000 unit bottle), DHEA 100mg/d and anastrozole 0.5 mg 2x/wk. No recent pharmacokinetic labs to help determine fine tuning. Clinically he is extremely happy. His low T f/u Q shows dramatic positives and he describes no AEs.
    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: For now we have decided to hold T therapy until a decision is made on the bx. If he has a bx, then will await the results before resuming. If he does not he would like to resume. He understands there is always a risk his tumor will become more aggressive.

    <Notes>Prostate Cancer See initial consult on 3/16/16. Pt dx 6 yrs ago and under the care of Dr. SXXXXX of UCLA 310 xxx-xxxx. 
    Original BX was 2010 and f/u bx was 2011 and more recently 1 year ago due to blip of PSA from 8 range to 12 range. Dr. xxxxx has advised continued active surveillance and has had no objection to the patient being on testosterone therapy. No pathology in our chart but patient states original was Gl 6 low grade. DRE by Dr. xxxxx recently apparently unremarkable. 
    Bx one year ago per patient - no cancer. 4K score per Dr. xxxxxx phone conversation shows 30% chance of more aggressive disease beyond Gl 6.</Notes>
